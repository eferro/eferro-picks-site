# Cursor AI Rules for eferro-picks-site

## Base Rules Reference

**üìã This file references the comprehensive development rules located at:**
**`.agents/rules/base.md`**

All core development guidelines, architecture principles, coding standards, and project-specific context are defined in the base rules file. Please refer to that file for the complete ruleset.

## Cursor-Specific Configuration

### Tool Integration
- Use Cursor's built-in TypeScript support for better code suggestions
- Leverage Cursor's testing integration to run `npm test -- --run` commands
- Utilize Cursor's git integration for frequent commits following TDD workflow

### Code Completion Behavior
- Prioritize suggestions that follow the `TalksFilter` centralized filtering pattern
- Suggest test-first development approach when creating new components
- Recommend proper TypeScript interfaces for all props and data structures

### File Navigation Hints
- Key files to reference: `src/utils/TalksFilter.ts`, `src/test/utils.tsx`
- Component structure: `src/components/ComponentName/index.tsx` + tests
- Type definitions: `src/types/talks.ts`

## Quick Reminders for Cursor AI

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Rules:**
1. **ALL filtering** ‚Üí `TalksFilter` class only
2. **Tests first** ‚Üí Write failing tests before implementation
3. **No watch mode** ‚Üí Always use `npm test -- --run`
4. **URL params** ‚Üí Only via `TalksFilter.fromUrlParams()` and `.toParams()`

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm test -- --run    # Run tests (never watch mode)
npm run build        # Build for production
npx tsc --noEmit     # Type check
```
