7. **Improve Site SEO & Sharing**
   - Optimize meta tags, structured data, and social previews for better discoverability.
8. **RSS Feed & Update Notifications**
   - Provide an RSS feed (and/or email updates) for new talks.
9. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Use pagination/infinite scroll, debounce filter changes, and lazy-load images.

## Actionable Tasks & Pending Improvements

### Filter UI & Navigation
- [ ] Move filter controls into a collapsible sidebar on desktop for easier access.

- [x] Initial load with `?author=` param should pre-select the author and filter talks.
- [ ] UI: add an "All authors" or "Clear author" control to reset author filter.
- [ ] Show a badge or count on active filters.
- [ ] Persist filter state across sessions (e.g. using localStorage).
- [ ] Accessibility: use `aria-pressed` on author buttons for better screen-reader support.
